# Leaflet Layers

Administer your Leaflet layers through the Drupal UI and combine layers from
multiple modules into bundles.

## Why?

By default you can choose between the maps provided by different modules.
But you cannot combine maps from different providers without creating a
module yourself.

With this module you get a interface for combining layers from different
modules into a bundle
you can use in your map.

It is also possible to add a layer directly through this module.
